# Gratitulendar

## Overview

This app was created for the Chingu Voyage 37 by Toucans-02.
The idea of this app is to allow an user to create and keep the record of the things he/she was gratefull for each day that he/she can view as a list of recent days or in a form of calendar.
Giving the nature of the tier one technology which is html/css with basic javascript this website is hardcoded and does not allow you to use the core functionalities of the idea. Instead it let's you discover the demo version of the idea, and creates the place where that idea could be taken further and brought to life.
